# Html5 Backwards Compatible Datepicker

A html5 datepicker by standard, that falls back to a jQuery date picker if the browser doesn't support html5 date inputs. Will fall back further to a text box by default.

All code is can be seen in the index.html, for a further explanation visit my blog post on this @ http://neil.red/coding/html5-backwards-compatable-datepicker/
